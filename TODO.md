# To do list for canonical names

 - [ ] Write a script to search for conflicting names
 - [ ] Export a releation. i.e., rewrite it as a list of all dependency definitions using canonical names
 - [ ] Find a way of adding 'comments' or some way of 'tagging' the definitions
 - [ ] The definitions should be simplied by removing useless filters
 - [ ] Definitions, which are just aliases should not introduce a new canonical name
 - [ ] Can we inline some references w/o changing the canonical name?
